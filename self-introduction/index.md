Hello i am etekle junior front end developer from Georgia tbilisi i am 30 years old. i have bachelors in marketing.  i was 29 whan i got interested in  programing. My first learning experience was in january 2022 georgian informational tecnology academy, which i just finished. During my period there i got introdused to rs school. At that time i was learning from anywhere i could, like from academy Udemy courses, YouTube and also rs school. I finished course and got my certificate but unfortunately I did not get job interview, so i decided to try again and frankly it was great idea. It allowed  me to compare my improvement how  much I have improved during that year of learning, which gave me lot of confudence. Best thing the course gave me is guide . for example we started with markup, than we went to js, after that we dove deeper into js. each task is designed to introduce you to next step in programing. Task that I am most proud of is Async race. It was my first experience with asynchronous js, which was not as hard as what i imagined. During the process of working on that task i have understood that my code became shorter and much more organized. For my future  I hope to fully learn angular and than start   my journey towards fullstack developer. In the end i am grateful to RS school and i hope i will continue my improvement.
